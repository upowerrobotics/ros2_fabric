"""
This module contains the function `generate_launch_description`.

The configuration of the nodes is defined in a yaml file, either given by the 'CONFIG_FILE_PATH'
environment variable or the default one located in 'param/pass_config.param.yaml'.
A `Config2Nodes` object is created to parse this configuration for environment 'env1', which then
generates the corresponding nodes.
Note: This file should not be removed even in custom, cause it is use to do 'colcon test'
